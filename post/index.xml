      <description>Project Background This project is a look into the behavior of distributed grids which there are both aggregators, producers and consumers. Today, the grid is primarily uni-directional - meaning the electricity is produced by producers, and consumed by consumers. If managed properly, enabling production by grid nodes which are historically consumers could lead to more accessible, resilient and efficient electrical grid system.
For this analysis, a Monte Carlo simulation is run with the following rules:</description>
