      <description>Project Background This project is a group effort collaboration for Syracuse University&amp;rsquo;s IST-718 - Big Data Analytics. The project, using pyspark explores a large dataset of car sales data. The motivation behind exploring this dataset stems from the COVID-19 pandemic; specifically in response to the emerging news of car payment re-structuring from many different dealerships. The economic impact of the pandemic must&amp;rsquo;ve negatively impacted the volume of sales for the automotive retail market as well as peoples ability to finance a car purchase.</description>

      <description>Project Background This project is a group effort collaboration for Syracuse University&amp;rsquo;s Marketing Analytics coursework. The project explores multiple data sources and data collection methods to attempt to organize streaming and gaming popularity data to be analyzed to observe the relationships between game success, game interest and game streaming metrics.
Overview The gaming community is unique in behavior, but is more unique in the potential to record, predict and model varying behavioral patterns within the community.</description>

      <description>Project Background This project is a look into the behavior of distributed grids which there are both aggregators, producers and consumers. Today, the grid is primarily uni-directional - meaning the electricity is produced by producers, and consumed by consumers. If managed properly, enabling production by grid nodes which are historically consumers could lead to more accessible, resilient and efficient electrical grid system.
For this analysis, a Monte Carlo simulation is run with the following rules:</description>

      <description>Project Background With climate change remaining a prevalent concern amongst many Americans for the foreseeable future, there has been some debate about how to approach the issue. Some consider the failure to act now a proverbial nail in the coffin, while others are optimistic that the rate of technological change will eventually help sort out this problem. William Nordhaus, who has been referred to as the leading mind in the economics of climate change, addresses the issue as a matter of careful cost-benefit consideration.</description>
